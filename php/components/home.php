			<p>Welcome to my website. Here, you'll find a selection of my work 
				and projects as I explore technology and programming. I've put
				together this site to share the various things I've been working on 
				and the ideas I've been developing along the way.</p>
			<p>Iâ€™m excited about the future and look forward to tackling new challenges and expanding 
				my knowledge. Feel free to explore and see where I'm headed next. You can
				learn more about me by reading my <a href="index.php?content=introduction">introduction</a>.</p>
